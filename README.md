Welcome to our project Artificial Intelligence for Bats  "AIBats"

We aim to analyze spectrograms to collect relevant characteristics of bat´s calls. So far we have classified bat´s sounds in a database to train different algorithms for supervised learning. For a test of the AIBast, we will use recordings from the mic of smartphones, which is an accessory customized for detecting ultrasound signals. The recording will be uploaded to a server. Data analysis and bat classification will be reported on a web site.
