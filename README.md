Welcome to our project Artificial Intelligence for Bats  "AIBats"

We aim to analyze spectrograms to collect relevant characteristics of bat´s calls. So far we have classified bat´s sounds in a database to train different algorithms for supervised learning. For a test of the AIBast, we will use recordings from the mic of smart phones, which is an accesory costumized for detecting ultrasound signals. The recording will be uploaded to a server. Data analisys and bat classification will be reported in as web site.
